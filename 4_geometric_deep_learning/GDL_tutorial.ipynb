For the (id, value) pairs, each value is uniquely associated to an id. The goal is, from the features of the root node, to predict the value corresponding to the node's id. In order to solve this task, all the leaves needs to send their (id, value) message to the root node, and the root needs to select the one with the same id as itself in order to find its corresponding value.

The *absolute positional encoding* summarizes the graph structure as node features (as we did above with the laplacian eigenvectors). On the other hand, the *relative positional encoding* represents the graph structure as an embedding of pairs of nodes (i.e. edges). Examples of relative positional encoding include boolean identifiers ($0$ for additional edges and a $1$ for the original topology), [resistance distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09505) or [shortest-path](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05234)."
